# Chess

Note that this code was written my Freshman year of college, before I had knowledge of proper source control, multithreading, and even UI management.
This code is not runnable as is, and has a few bad bugs. If you wish to see an updated and working version of a chess program that I am working on, please refer to https://github.com/Fisherswamp/JavaChess
